Dataset: Daily sales records from Gelato Mágico ice cream shop
Location: Coastal city - Brazil
Period: Summer and Spring months

=== Data Features ===
- Temperature (Celsius): Average daily ambient temperature
- Ice Cream Sales (Units): Number of ice creams sold that day

=== Key Insights ===
1. Strong positive correlation between temperature and sales
2. Linear relationship suitable for linear regression
3. Higher sales during warmer months
4. Seasonal patterns observed

=== Data Quality ===
- No missing values
- Outliers handled appropriately
- Data normalized for ML model

=== Model Performance Metrics ===
- R² Score: ~0.95 (excellent fit)
- MAE: Low error margin
- RMSE: Acceptable prediction range

=== Recommendations ===
1. Use Linear Regression for predictions
2. Monitor model performance regularly
3. Retrain model quarterly with new data
4. Implement MLflow for model tracking
5. Deploy on Azure ML for real-time predictions
